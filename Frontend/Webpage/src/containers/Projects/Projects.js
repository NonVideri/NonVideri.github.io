          I love board games. Out of this love was born the Randomizer â€” an app
          created to serve as an aid for picking random items from a list. Its
          biggest use is in picking random cards from a list, although you can
          also use it for tasks such as throwing dice. Who needs actual
          components when you have the Randomizer?
